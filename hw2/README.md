**Requirements**

* Used sdsl library for standard int vector data structure. It can be installed from here: https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite
* C++2O compatible compiler
* Python3.8 with pandas and matplotlib for plotting the graphs

**Resources Used**

**Brief Description**

* There are 3 classes `rank_support`, `select_support` and `sparse_aray`
* Corresponding to each of these there is a test function in `main.cpp` which gets called by default
* The test functions dump a text file as output
* For plotting the graphs, I have used python and the code is available in the jupyter notebook in the root directory.
