**Requirements**

* Used sdsl library for standard bit vector data structure. It can be installed from here: https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite
* C++2O compatible compiler
* Python3.8 with pandas and matplotlib for plotting the graphs


**Brief Description**

* There are 3 classes `rank_support`, `select_support` and `sparse_aray`
